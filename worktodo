To do:
1. Finish Extracting Images
2. Image Clustering
3. Regression Analysis
4. Analyze Data
Challenges:
1. I initially hoped to use reddit for this, but I could not find a package that would
allow me to scrape reddit. I switched to instagram, but I did not have enough permissions,
so I came back to reddit. 
2. When I thought I finally found a data scraper, the topics that I chose
were blocked by the platform, due to it being a sensitive topic
3. I have only been able to obtain 102 observations, when I adjust my code to obtain more,
way less observations come up. The most I have been able to obtain are 102.
