In the era of digital communication, social media platforms have become more than socialization hubs, evolving into powerful domains for political activism. Images play a significant role in capturing attention and stimulating user enagement. Understanding how different types of images influence user interaction can provide valuable insights for researchers, content creators and platform developers. 

This project aims to delve into image based engagement on Reddit through image clustering and regression analysis. I hope to shed light on visual factors that drive engagement.
